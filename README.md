# Product API

Hello, world.

This is my first ever Rust project.

This project is a version of a Product management API coded in Rust. The original version was done in C# for a college class I took. Some concepts that it utilizes include but are not limited to: OOP, Design Patterns, File Management, Data Serialization, and HTTP Requests.  I will slowly be building this by converting parts of the C# API into Rust as I go through the rust lang book. Eventually, I want to connect this with a simple React web app.

Side note: I also want to practice TDD with this project.
